# MicrowaveSintering
Repository for the code that runs the microwave furnace. The main code block is the MicroSinterIOClass.py: this contains the code for the UI and the open loop control that is being used at the moment. 
Other code that will be added will be the scripts used to configure a raspberry pi from scratch and download all the necessary packages and what not.
